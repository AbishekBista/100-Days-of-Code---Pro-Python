Typography

1. Express the mood of the website
2. Two large families - serifs and sans serifs
3. Serifs have crooked feet while sans serifs have 90 degree angle to the base
4. Serifs - serious, authoritative, older, traditional, stable, respectable
5. Sans serif - friendly, more approachable, novel, contemporary, sensible, simple, straight-forward (Humanist) -> readable for body text
6. Legibility - open space, gap between letters, unambiguous form (g or 9) and varying proportions
7. Don't use lots of fonts, two is enough
8. Keeps these things in mind when combining two fonts:
    -> Similar - Mood of the fonts and time-era
    -> Contrast - Serif-ness and weights of the head and the body
9. Try to keep away from these fonts - Comic Sans, Kristen, Greek, Curlz, Viner, Papyrus
