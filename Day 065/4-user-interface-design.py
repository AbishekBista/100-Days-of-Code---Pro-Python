User Interface Design

1. Hierarchy -> Highlight the most important part of the information first
    Color
        -> Use color, icon and background with high contrast generate higher hierarchy for the icon
        -> Use neutral color, but use accent tone like green or red to pull the eyes towards the UI

    Size
        -> Bigger items draw more attention like CTA buttons

2. Layout
    -> Mix the layout to make the design more interesting
    -> Keep the width of the line to 40-60 characters
    -> Chop the UI to smaller pieces

3. Alignment
    -> Don't mix alignment (center and left)
    -> Reduce the number of alignment points

4. White Space
    -> Give more whitespaces around an element, space things out, makes the element more important
    -> It becomes minimalist and elevated

5. Design for your audience
    -> Design will always come down to the audience
    -> Have the flexibility, so that you don't always design the same style
