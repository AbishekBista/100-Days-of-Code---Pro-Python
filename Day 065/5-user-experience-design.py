User Experience Design

1. Designs by developers and the way user use the app may be different
2. Our job is to make sure the developer design is unobstructive to the user
3. Lets the user do their thing effortlessly


Principle
1. Simplicity
    Keep things simple, chop up content

2. Consistency
    Applies to both functionality and look
    Don't go about changing UI where user expect them to be.
    Don't make them relearn how to use the app.

3. Reading Patterns
    F-pattern: Start at top-left, track to right and goes down the left gutter
    Z-pattern: Left to right, zig-zag, like reading book

4. All platform website
    Think about mobile responsive design
    Also think about wide display design
    Rearrange things but keep the difference minimal
    No banners
    Don't upscale drastically for mobile

5. Don't use your power for evil
    Dark patterns - It is a form of bad user experience
    Help people do what they want to do
    Keeping disclaimer very ambiguous
